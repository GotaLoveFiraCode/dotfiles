# Neovim Config

This is my neovim configuration. I have made it as minimal as I am comfortable with, and as fast as I can manage in the limited amount of time I have (did we not all love school?). I am a keyboard-centric user (colemak BTW) on linux. I type quickly and have a low focus on completions, for a while I used *AI* stuff, but I got sick of the lag it created. That is pretty much it. I made this for myself, so it is not very easily customized for other people, you will have to mess around. Good luck.

## Plugins

According to lazy I have 68 plugins installed. I try to remove any I do not have a use for. I used to use a couple others, but I learned to live without them, and I think I am better off for it.
